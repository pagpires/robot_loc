### Inferring robot location by Maximum a posteriori estimation

This an implementation for the homework assignment of MITx's Computational Probability. 

You are given a series of observation of robot (locations with noises), and you are supposed to infer the robot state (locations and direction) using Maximum a posteriori estimation (MAP).
